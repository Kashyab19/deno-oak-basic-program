# deno-oak-basic-program
I am starting out on exploring deno.js and how it is different from node.js.And no,as far as nodejs is concerned it ain't going anywhere

Downloading Deno.js for Windows is little tricky when compared to Linux/Mac as it does not have a NPM yet!😏

🏊 Follow the documentation from https://deno.land/#installation

As you can see there two files(server.ts and api.ts),those are independent files(Ofc,You will know it when you go through it!)

🤨To run it :

deno run --allow-net --allow-env server.ts
(or)
deno run --allow-net --allow-env api.ts

🤨Wondering why?
deno has preliminary secure run-time server!
